      'EKO is a research terminal and a set of tools for Robinhood Chain. It shows chain data, risk checks and AI-generated analysis, lets you trade from your own wallet, and lets you connect your own trading agent so it checks with EKO before it places an order.',
      'EKO’s analysis is general research shared with every user. It is not investment advice and not a recommendation to buy or sell anything. You make your own decisions and you carry the risk of any loss.',
      DYOR,
    ] },
    { title: 'Your wallet, your keys', paragraphs: [
      'EKO is non-custodial. Your wallet signs every trade and every token approval, and approvals are for the exact amount of the trade. EKO’s servers never hold your private keys or your funds, and EKO never receives your Robinhood login details.',
      'Before you sign, check the token, amount, route, network and fees your wallet shows you. Network gas, venue fees, token taxes, slippage and failed transactions can all cost money.',
    ] },
    { title: 'Live trading', paragraphs: [
      'Live trading can be paused at any time, for example during an outage or while a required check is unavailable. While it is paused, you can still scan coins and paper trade.',
      'Live trades can be limited by a per-trade cap. EKO does not trade stocks, stock tokens or perpetual futures for you.',
      'Before EKO offers a live trade, it checks your trading wallet against the US Treasury’s OFAC sanctions list. If your wallet is listed, or the check cannot be completed, EKO does not offer the trade.',
    ] },
    { title: 'Fees', paragraphs: [
      'Terminal fee: 0% during launch week, until token day. Network, venue and token fees still apply.',
      'Planned from token day: a 0.5% terminal fee on Uniswap-routed trades, lower with a tier, paid straight to the public burn wallet. The burn wallet’s balance is burned daily by hand, and every transaction is posted. Pons-curve trades carry no terminal fee at launch. Terminal fees never go to the dev wallet.',

      'Connected agents: if you connect a trading agent, EKO stores the agent, its settings, the checks it runs and its access keys. Keys are stored as keyed hashes, not in readable form.',
      'The Flight Recorder journal is opt-in. Private entries are encrypted with a key that belongs to your account. Only salted hashes of entries go into public receipts.',
      'Usage and speed: the app sends anonymous measurements, such as which screen loaded and how long it took. They are not linked to your wallet.',
      'Technical data: EKO’s servers process your IP address to limit abuse and keep the service running, and record errors so they can be fixed.',

Agent journal and check records stay until you delete them, or 30 days after account deletion. Public chain data and receipts are kept permanently so they stay checkable.',

Beta forecasts describe possible behavior; they do not predict prices or direct trades. Verify source evidence and timestamps independently.',
