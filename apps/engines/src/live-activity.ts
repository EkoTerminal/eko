/**
 * Live activity for EngineWorker polls. A poll reads what changed since the previous poll instead of aggregating every
 * swap, transfer, liquidity and Pons event of every coin (production 2026-10-08: minutes per poll, then out of memory),
 * and plans exactly the checkpoints a full-history poll plans. Memory holds one small record per coin active in the
 * last seven days and eight days of block times; everything else read in a poll is bounded by the new activity.
 *
 * - Every poll re-reads every coin's rows above the previous poll minus ACTIVITY_LOOKBACK_BLOCKS (the indexer's reorg
 *   window). engine_activity_changes (migration 0189) reports every other write: rows written or rewritten at older
 *   blocks, pool and launch changes, and block times.
 * - A coin's revision sums its rows' shares (partHash); engine_activity_state keeps the sum and newest event time of
 *   its rows at or below `to - ACTIVITY_LOOKBACK_BLOCKS`, so the next poll adds only the rows above. A base the log
 *   invalidated, or one never written, is recomputed in the database for coins that changed; until a coin changes,
 *   its stored revision stands (it would be recomputed to the same value).
 * - Plans resume after the coin's newest checkpoint that does not depend on the past (CadenceStart): its newest block at
 *   or below the previous plan with non-swap activity and a stored time. A coin with none (a new coin, or swaps only)
 *   is planned from its launch.
 * - A new process follows the persisted watermark (engine_activity_feed) and takes the coins active in the last seven
 *   days from engine_activity_state. Without a live log (first start, or a day without a live engine) it fills every
 *   missing block time once, as coinActivity does on every call, and takes recent coins from the activity tables by
 *   time.
 *
 * Block times are assumed not to decrease with height (as outcomes.ts and refreshClock do); a transfer row is assumed to
 * be timestamped no more than ten minutes before the newest stored block at or below the window unless the log names its
 * coin.
