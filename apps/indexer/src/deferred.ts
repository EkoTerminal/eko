 * trading in such a pool had no history (2026-10-13: 239,000 events of 156 known pools, 912,000 in all).
 * No chain read: the raw log, the pool row and the stored tokens decode it. The rows are written as the head writes
 * them for a pool outside the sender scope without the transaction's transfers: no trader (the worker names it from
 * stored transfers where there are any, or the v3 event's own recipient stands), ETH-quoted swaps unpriced (the
 * worker prices them). Only events deeper than the reorg depth are taken, and only when the stored block hash, where
 * there is one, is the log's. A log whose block is missing its time is left as it is.
